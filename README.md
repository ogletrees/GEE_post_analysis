## Analysis of Google Earth Engine forum posts

[analysis](https://ogletrees.github.io/GEE_post_analysis/analysis) |  

This project set out to analyze the posts made on the Google Earth Engine help forum.

Google Earth Engine is a platform for analyzing satellite data and makes this type of work much easier for the researcher. To quote from the [source](https://earthengine.google.com):

> Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.

Earth Engine was started in 2010 (as far as I can tell) and has become a great tool for doing simple to complex analysis of satellite imagery. 

If you use Earth Engine you might encounter issues that others can help with. Of course, you should consult the documentation first, but a help forum is available where other users and staff can help out. In my work I have found many answers on the forum and this led me to wonder what has been discussed in the many posts over time.
